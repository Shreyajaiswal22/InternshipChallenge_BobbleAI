Character Tree serialization
Goal
Write a program to create a custom tree data structure using linked list (tree of characters),
serialize it and store it in a file and deserialize it and load it back to data structure. The program
can accept two command line arguments
1. create
2. load
“create” argument should read words from the csv file, create tree of characters and then
serialize it and save it to the file-path accepted after csv file name
i) Example: ./executable create csv-file.csv serialized-output.bin
“load” argument should read the serialized file, recreate the character tree and print all the
words present in the tree.
ii) Example: ./executable load serialized-output.bin
Language
C / C++ / Java
Example Input
Content of csv-file.csv
Hello
World
Foo
Bar
Note:
1. Do not use build-in data structure for tree.
